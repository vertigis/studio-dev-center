[Events](#events) are distinct, discrete messaging about a change or update that occurs in the viewer. They can be used to initiate behaviors, communicate data changes, and more. Events themselves do not execute behavior, but merely provide messaging so subscribers can act on changes. You can learn more about events in the [event reference](sdk-events-reference.mdx)
