---

If you only need to modify the app config and layout of a VertiGIS Studio Mobile application, you can use the [VertiGIS Studio Mobile Designer](https://apps.vertigisstudio.com/mobile/designer/) interface. However, if you need to write custom code, you will need to deploy and manage a custom application.

### Application with Custom Code

The Quickstart provided is a standard MAUI application, and can be deployed in accordance to the [MAUI deployment guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/deployment/).
