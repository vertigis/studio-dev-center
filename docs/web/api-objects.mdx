## Features

There are a number of different ways that map features can be represented in the VertiGIS Web and Mobile APIs. While you should usually use [`FeatureProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.Feature.FeatureProperties) JSON when creating inputs for commands and operations, you may see other feature representations in the outputs of operations, in event payloads, or in the supplied context.

### Feature

The base class that represents GIS features in the Vertigis Web and Mobile APIs, this object is analogous to and often directly represents an ESRI [`Graphic`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Graphic.html) that has been added to the map or loaded in a table.

-   A new feature may be instantiated with a [`FeatureProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.Feature.FeatureProperties) JSON object:
    ```
    new Feature(arg: FeatureProperties)
    ```
-   You can retrieve this JSON object from a feature by calling `toJSON()` on the feature.

-   After creation, most of these properties are read only. You may alter a feature's `geometry` property, but only if the new geometry type matches the old. The current feature geometry type is available on the `geometryType` property.

-   A non-spatial feature from a table will not have a geometry.

-   You can create a new ESRI [`Graphic`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-Graphic.html) by calling the `toGraphic()` method on any `Feature`.

### FeatureSet

A collection of `Features` that shares a common [`Schema`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.Schema.SchemaProperties), typically because they have all come from the same `FeatureSource`, eg: a single layer in the map.

-   You may create a new FeatureSet with a [`FeatureSetProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.FeatureSet.FeatureSetProperties) JSON object. Calling `toJSON()` will return this object.

-   You can add a `Feature` or collection of `Features` to a `FeatureSet`. They must follow the same `Schema`:
    ```
    add(feature: Feature)
    addMany(features: Iterable<Feature>)
    ```
-   You can delete a single `Feature` or a collection of `Features`. You can also clear the entire `FeatureSet`:
    ```
    delete(feature: Feature)
    deleteMany(features: Iterable<Feature>)
    clear()
    ```
-   You can query for the existence of a feature, or find a feature by its Object ID:
    ```
    has(feature: Feature)
    findByPrimaryKey(primaryKey: string)
    ```
-   You can iterate through every feature in the FeatureSet:
    ```
    forEach(feature => { ... })
    ```

### FeatureList

A read-only view of a `FeatureSet` that can be filtered and sorted. The `FeatureList` will always update as the underlying `FeatureSet` changes.

-   You may create a new `FeatureList` directly from a `FeatureSet` or from a [`FeatureListProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.FeatureList.FeatureListProperties) JSON object:
    ```
    new FeatureList(args: FeatureSet | FeatureListProperties)
    ```
-   Calling `toJSON()` will return the [`FeatureListProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.FeatureList.FeatureListProperties).

-   You can pass in the name of a field in the backing `FeatureSet` to sort alphabetically or numerically on that field:
    ```
    sort(criteria: string)
    ```
-   You can pass in a string to to filter the `FeatureList` by. Each searchable field will then be queried for the existence of the string. This operation does not alter the underlying `FeatureSet`:
    ```
    filter(criteria: string)
    ```

### FeatureStream

A read-only stream of Features that must be read asynchronously.

-   You may create a `FeatureStream` with a [`FeatureStreamProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.FeatureStream.FeatureStreamProperties) JSON object, or with any collection of Features:
    ```
    new FeatureStream(args: Iterable<Feature> | AsyncIterable<Feature> | FeatureStreamProperties)
    ```
-   Calling `toJSON()` will return the [`FeatureStreamProperties`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.FeatureStream.FeatureStreamProperties).

-   You can read the features asynchronously into an array or into a `FeatureSet`:
    ```
    toArray(): Promise<Feature[]>
    toFeatureSet(): Promise<FeatureSet>
    ```

## Extensions

API objects ending in `*Extension` wrap and extend objects that exist in ESRI's API. Each extension makes the ESRI object available on a named property, and has an `itemType` property that contains the type of the `Extension`.

Here is a table listing common `*Extensions` along with their corresponding ESRI JSAPI item, the property where this ESRI object is made available on the `*Extension`, and their `itemType`.

| \*Extension             | ESRI JSAPI Object                                                                                               | Object Property | Item Type                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |

### LayerExtensions

There are a number of `*Extensions` that inherit from `LayerExtension` and wrap different ESRI layer types. They share an `itemType` of `layer-extension` but the type of the object attached to the `layer` property varies by extension. Unless otherwise specified, these are all valid wherever a `LayerExtension` is called for:

| LayerExtension               | ESRI JSAPI Object                                                                                                       |

There should be a corresponding `*Extension` for every valid ESRI layer type, this list is not comprehensive.

## FeatureSource

A `FeatureSource` is any source of features. Typically this is a `FeatureLayerExtension` backed by a [`FeatureLayer`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-FeatureLayer.html), but this isn't required. A `FeatureSource` has a [`Schema`](api-argument-definitions.mdx#definition-@vertigis.arcgis-extensions.data.Schema.SchemaProperties) defining the type of features it holds.
