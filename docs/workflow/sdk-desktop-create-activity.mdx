This article will walk you through creating a new workflow activity for VertiGIS Studio Desktop applications.

## Prerequisites

<DesktopPrereqs />

## Create the Activity

1. If you haven't done yet, create a new Visual Studio project using the `ArcGIS Pro Module Add-In` project template.
2. Create a new file `MyCustomActivity.cs` in the previously mentioned project.
3. Add a new skeleton workflow activity that implements `IActivityHandler`.

```cs title="MyCustomActivity.cs"
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using VertiGIS.Workflow.Runtime;

// highlight-next-line
[assembly:WorkflowActivities]
namespace Poc_ProCustomActivities
{
    public class MyCustomActivity : IActivityHandler
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        public static string Action => "uuid:cc39c481-4d05-4c39-8363-07b79dc03aa7::MyCustomActivity";

        public Task<IDictionary<string, object>> Execute(IDictionary<string, object> inputs, IActivityContext context)
        {
            IDictionary<string, object> outputs = new Dictionary<string, object>();

            outputs["test"] = "Hello World. This is a custom activity.";

            return Task.FromResult(outputs);
        }
    }
}
```

:::important
It's important to conform to two necessary constraints to make the activity recognizable to VertiGIS Studio Desktop:

1.  Inside your assembly you need to add the `WorkflowActivites` attribute (make sure to add it only once across your whole project, e.g. in your module rather than inside your activity)
2.  Your custom activity needs to contain an action identifier that tells VertiGIS Studio Desktop what activity is represented by this implementation. This can be achieved by declaring a static string property named `Action` that returns the activities action id. As static members cannot be specified in interfaces, you have to ensure this property being present yourself.

Ignoring any of those rules will lead to the activity not being found by VertiGIS Studio Desktop and thus cause a runtime error.
:::

## Use the Activity in a Workflow

Workflows that run in your custom VertiGIS Studio Desktop application can now run this custom activity.

:::tip
[Registering stubs for .NET activities](sdk-net-register-activities.mdx) provides a user friendly interface for your custom activities in VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/desktop-designer-run-activity.png")} />
:::

Without registering stubs you may still call your custom activity using the [`RunActivity`](https://docs.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____167) by the name defined in `MyCustomActivity.cs` (for this example, `uuid:cc39c481-4d05-4c39-8363-07b79dc03aa7::MyCustomActivity`).

:::note

<p>
    You can{" "}
    <a
        href={useBaseUrl("workflows/desktop-create-activity.json")}
        download="custom-activity-workflow.json"
        target="_blank"
    >
        download this demo workflow
    </a>{" "}
    that runs the custom activity and
    <a
        href="https://docs.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/import-export-workflows.htm"
        target="_blank"
    >
        {" "}
        import it into the VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer.{" "}
    </a>
</p>
:::

Next you need to run the workflow you just created in your VertiGIS Studio Desktop project.
