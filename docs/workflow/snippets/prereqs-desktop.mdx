:::info Important
While extending VertiGIS Studio Workflow for Desktop can easily be achieved, you require an installed Workflow runtime module to make your custom activities work with VertiGIS Studio Desktop.

To ease using your custom activities when authoring of Workflows with Workflow Designer, you may create method stubs for your activities and publish them to make them, as described in [the corresponding chapter](/docs/workflow/sdk-net-register-activities.mdx).

A working knowledge of [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/dotnet/csharp/) and [.NET Standard](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard) is recommended before extending Workflow for VertiGIS Studio Desktop
